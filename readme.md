[See the demo...](http://chrisdavies.github.io/tiny-date-picker/)


## Installation

    npm install --save tiny-date-picker


## Usage

Include a reference to `tiny-date-picker.css` and `tiny-date-picker.js`, then call it like this:

```javascript
// Initialize a date picker on the specified input element
TinyDatePicker(document.querySelector('input'));
```

You can also pass in options as an optional second argument:

```javascript
// Initialize a date picker using truncated month names
TinyDatePicker(document.querySelector('input'), {
  months: ['Jan', 'Feb', 'Mar', 'Apr', 'May', 'Jun', 'Jul', 'Aug', 'Sep', 'Oct', 'Nov', 'Dec'],
});
```

The input to which the date picker is attached will fire its `change` event
any time the date value chanegs.

The DatePicker context is returned by the `TinyDatePicker`. See below for further details.

```javascript
// Initialize a date picker on the specified input element
const dp = TinyDatePicker(document.querySelector('input'));

// Show the date picker
dp.open();
```


## Options

Below is an example of all option parameters:

```javascript

TinyDatePicker(document.querySelector('input'), {
  // Used to convert a date into a string to be used as the value of input
  format: function (date) {
    return date.toLocaleDateString();
  },

  // Used to parse a date string and return a date (e.g. parsing the input value)
  parse: function (str) {
    var date = new Date(str);
    return isNaN(date) ? new Date() : date;
  },

  // Names of months, in order
  months: ['January', 'February', 'March', 'April', 'May', 'June', 'July', 'August', 'September', 'October', 'November', 'December'],

  // Names of days of week, in order
  days: ['Sun', 'Mon', 'Tue', 'Wed', 'Thu', 'Fri', 'Sat'],

  // The text for the button used to set the date to today's date
  today: 'Today',

  // The text for the button used to clear the input value
  clear: 'Clear',

  // The text for the button used to close the form
  close: 'Close',

  // Specifies the minimum date that can be selected
  min: '10/1/2016',

  // Specifies the maximum date that can be selected
  max: '10/22/2016',

  // Place datepicker selector on this date if field is still empty
  preselectedDate: '10/20/2016',

  // There are two modes: dp-modal (the default) and dp-below.
  // dp-modal makes the date picker show up as a modal.
  // dp-below makes it show up beneath its input element.
  mode: 'dp-below',

  // Whether to use Monday as start of the week
  weekStartsMonday: false,

  // A function which is called any time the date picker opens
  onOpen: function (context) {
    // context is the datepicker context, detailed below
  },

  // A function which is called any time the year is selected
  // in the year menu
  onSelectYear: function (context) {
    // context is the datepicker context, detailed below
  },

  // A function which is called any time the month is selected
  // in the month menu
  onSelectMonth: function (context) {
    // context is the datepicker context, detailed below
  },
});
```

## Context

The `onOpen`, `onSelectYear`, and `onSelectMonth` event handlers receive the date picker context object. This has many properties and methods, the most useful of which are as follows:

### Properties

- currentDate: the currently selected date (a Date object)
- input: the input element to which the date picker is bound

### Methods

- open: opens the modal
- close: closes the modal
- openYears: shows the modal with the years menu showing
- openMonths: shows the modal with the months menu showing
- setValue: sets the date as a string value


## Style

All CSS class names begin with `dp-`, and every element in the calendar has a class. The style rules
in `tiny-date-picker.css` have been kept as unspecific as possible so they can be easily overruled.

For more info, launch a date picker and use the browser dev tools to inspect its structure and shape.


## Aria

There is currently no Aria support baked into Tiny Date Picker, but it is planned.


## Bundling

This library is [CommonJS](http://www.commonjs.org/) compatible, so you can use it in this way:

```javascript
var TinyDatePicker = require('tiny-date-picker'),

TinyDatePicker(document.querySelector('input'));
```

Or, with ES6:

```javascript
import TinyDatePicker from 'tiny-date-picker',

TinyDatePicker(document.querySelector('input'));
```


## Contributing

First, you'll need to have selenium installed and running, as detailed [here](http://webdriver.io/guide/getstarted/install.html) and you'll need to serve the test HTML page by running `npm start`.

    npm test

If all is well, build your changes:

    npm run min
